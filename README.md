# Bührig Metrics Reproducible Pipeline

**Reproducible geometric and computational pipeline for Bührig-type metrics in submarine canyons**

**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Status:** Stable methodological release

---

## Overview

This repository contains the **reproducible computational implementation** of a geometric pipeline designed to compute **Bührig-type transverse metrics** in real submarine canyons, with particular emphasis on **shore-connected systems** characterized by asymmetric geometry, lack of ideal orthogonality to the thalweg, and complex bathymetric relief.

The pipeline explicitly resolves the gap between the **conceptual definition of Bührig metrics** and their **rigorous application** to transverse profiles extracted from real submarine digital elevation models (DEMs).

The project is conceived as a **methodological infrastructure**, not as a collection of isolated scripts, integrating explicit geometric formalization, computational traceability, and geomorphological validation at both individual-profile and global scales.

---

## Project scope and blocks

This repository corresponds to **Block 2 (Computational Implementation)** of the **Bührig Metrics Project** and contains exclusively the **reproducible computational pipeline**.

The complete **conceptual, geometric, and methodological framework** is documented in an independent manual (Block 1), published with DOI:

> **Viveros Velásquez, M. A. (2026).**  
> *Manual for the reproducible geometric and computational implementation of Bührig-type metrics in submarine canyons* (Version 1.0.0).  
> Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18446821

The manual constitutes the **primary methodological reference** for metric definitions, geometric assumptions, key-point construction (P1–P4), and pipeline design logic.

This repository must be interpreted and cited **in conjunction with the manual**.

The pipeline consists of **nine strictly sequential stages**, executed from DEM preparation to **individual and global geomorphological validation** of transverse profiles.

---

## Input data

The pipeline requires a minimal and explicitly defined set of inputs:

- A submarine **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** derived from GMRT, reprojected to a metric CRS (UTM).
- A vector representation of the **main canyon thalweg**.
- Vector representations of the **left and right canyon edges**.

These datasets constitute the geometric foundation for transversal profile generation, key-point extraction (P1–P4), and morphometric metric computation.

---

## Access and use status

This repository is **closed** and provided exclusively for:

- scientific reference,
- methodological documentation,
- and formal citation.

Access to the full source code, processed data, and pipeline execution is **restricted**.

The closed status reflects the **pre-commercial and research-grade nature** of the development, which constitutes an original scientific–technological asset.

---

## Citation

Until a dedicated DOI is assigned to this repository, the **methodological manual (Block 1)** should be cited as the authoritative reference:

> Viveros Velásquez, M. A. (2026). *Manual for the reproducible geometric and computational implementation of Bührig-type metrics in submarine canyons* (Version 1.0.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18446821

Once a DOI is assigned to this repository, the pipeline should be cited as **versioned software**, using the citation provided in `CITATION.cff`.
